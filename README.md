# Task-List

The Task List App is a user friendly application which people of all ages can use to list down all the things they would like to achieve. 
Adults and children can even use it to list all their New Year's resolutions throughout the entire year.

Users will be able to:

- create a list of tasks

- delete the tasks they have already done

- filter through their tasks

- clear all the tasks if they would like to start a new list

- close the application and open it again with all their tasks still saved 


Coding Achievements:

- Used Materialize,a responsive front-end framework to structure and style my UI
- Created list Elements in javascript
- Persisted the data to local storage which included using JSON.parse and JSON.stringify to store the tasks as an array of strings
- Made the data in local storage keep showing in the DOM even after loading the page
- Added a confirmation alert upon clicking on the delete icon when wanting to delete a task
- Built a function that filters through the tasks
- Added a clear all button
